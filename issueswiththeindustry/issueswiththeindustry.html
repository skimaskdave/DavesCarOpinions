		<h1>Issues With The Industry</h1>
		<p>In this section I talk about what I think are the issues with the industry, and maybe every now and then I will throw in some things that I like about the industry. By this I mean things that car manufacturers are adding to cars that I think are stupid or unnecessary.</p>

	<div class="infotainment_screens">
		<h2>Infotainment Screens</h2>
		<p>Lets get this one out the way quickly, you've probably seen someone complaining about these before.</p>
		<p>Screens in cars now are getting ridiculous. At their best I think that they should tell you where you are going, what is on the radio and include a hands-free calling feature (because some people who are very important need to make phone calls - not me. I don't need to make phone calls when I am in the car). Nowadays they do so much more than that, like house heating controls and in some cars (Tesla) let you turn the headlights on and put it into drive or reverse, and all the other features that you do not need when you are driving, like Netflix. I cannot think of a time where I have been driving down the road and gone "you know what I need now? That's right I need to watch an episode of Friends or the Big Bang Theory or Suits". That's because when you are driving you should focus on the driving, not on the screen in the middle screening your favourite tv show. While I would love to work in the automotive industry in the future (writing software - ironic I know) I do not think that these are necessary and I get why companys do it - to save money - because it is cheaper to stick the heating controls in the screen and write some software for it than it is to make a button out of plastic for it. But it is stupid!!! Stop with the screens. It is no longer a car with a screen inside, it is an iPad with a car attached to it (if you have seen the TikTok/Instagram Reel you will know the angry French bloke I am quoting).<p>

	<div class="touch_sensitive_buttons">
		<h2>Touch Sensitive Buttons</h2>
		<p>I want to make it very clear I have never used touch sensitive buttons in a car - I haven't ever been in a car that new. This is something I am very grateful for. I get why manufacturers make these choices, it's like putting the controls in the screen - it's cheaper. You wouldn't think that though because of the HUGE price tag cars come with these days. Why does the average car cost over Â£40,000? That's ridiculous! Touch sensitive buttons are no better than putting the controls in the infotainment screen, after all, it is just as fiddily if not more.</p>

	<div class="performance">
		<h2>Performance</h2>
		<p>In my opinion car manufacturers these days are focused too much on straight line speed and not enough about handling. Cars being built today are incredibly fuel efficient (they claim) and powerful. If you look at how far engines have progressed it is very impressive how we can now get so much more power out of a significantly smaller engine (of course some turbo charging might be involved). That is impressive. However, car manufacturers seem to have forgotten on the whole about handling (not Gordon Murray though, him and his team are doing an excellent job). Cars are too heavy. <a target="_blank "href="../mycar/mycar.html">My car</a> (kerb weight) is less than a tonne, around 900kg I think. It handles fairly well in my opinion, with a little body roll, but you expect that on stock suspension for a hatchback. The Mazda MX-5 (mk4) that I drove recently - which by the way was epic - handles incredibly well (I think it weighs around 1000-1100kg). It was a lot of fun driving that car and it is a lot of fun driving my car, because the cars aren't too heavy. It made me think about how modern cars focus too much on speed in a straight line and not fun round bends. In my opinion the MX-5 I drove had just the right amount of power, it felt quick, nippy and planted. I didn't feel like it needed to go any faster because it was fun driving around twisty bends. As it is somewhat quick (0-60 in 6.1 seconds), but you don't need to go faster than that! It was perfect for the roads in the UK because it was a lot of fun and I didn't break the speed limit to have that fun. Car manufacturers, please add lightness, and good handling. You don't need air suspension if your car is under 1500kg.</p>
