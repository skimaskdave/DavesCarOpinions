		<h1>Concept Cars</h1>
		<p>In this section I talk about new car concepts from different manufacturers and my opinions on them.
		<br>
		To save you (and me) some time. I don't really like electric cars, but even if I don't like electric cars, most concept cars will be electric and I will judge them not just by how they are powered, but also how they look, and what innovative features the car companies have put into their cars.
		<br>
		In addition, I include a link to where you can find out more information about the cars above my opinions.</p>

		<h3>Citroën Oli</h3>

		<p>For starters, I don't understand what this is meant to be. It looks ridiculous. I love it. Even though I dislike electric cars and I think that SUVs were the most useless creation ever created by humans, this is just so stupid it makes sense. This isn't the first time Citroën have done this either. Have you seen the Citroën Ami? That thing is also stupid, electric and hilarious.

		It's electric. Okay so that sucks, but I don't think that what this car was made for was to be a motorway cruiser. I think it is designed for trundling around town and being a fashion statement. It is certainly a statement. I don't mind the fact it is electric because if I owned it, I wouldn't drive it a lot anyway. I think it is built for short journeys and to be useable, but nothing more. I like that. They have gone with the concept of making this car as light as possible, which I think is a step in the right direction for cars, as far too many cars these days are becoming too heavy and cumbersome. They also haven't fitted the interior with an ugly and useless infotainment screen. Thank god for that... there are buttons!!!

		You could say that this car comes with all the "essentials" a car should have and nothing more. It comes with light air conditioning, a speaker for your music and a method of propulsion. THAT IS ALL YOU NEED OUT OF A CAR. I mean to be honest you don't even need air conditioning or music that is a feature that exists purely for our comfort.

		To finish off what I think is becoming quite a strange, convuluted rant is to say that Citroën have designed a car that does what a car should, and nothing more. For this I commend them. If I was a rich person who had more money than sense I would buy one for the laughs. It is a cool car.</p>
		<h3>Citroën 19_19</h3>
		<p>You can read about the 19_19 here: <a href="https://www.citroen.co.uk/about-citroen/concept-cars/19-19.html" target="_blank">Click on this link (will open a new tab)</a></p>
		<p>This car looks cool. I fear I am going to write that a lot on this page. It looks like a space ship, but not a 2008 Civic Type R space ship (yikes). It looks epic and it sits on 30 inch wheels (that's INSANE). I don't think this concept car will ever actually become a reality, its made of perspex so you can see inside from the outside, even the drivers legs. I like the Citroën logo built into the light bar at the front and rear end of the car. Inside the car they have added some fancy weird looking seats that are meant to be very comfortable. I don't see any seatbelts in this... Each passenger also has their own "sound zone", now this sounds like a good concept but I feel like it won't work in reality. I will be sat in the drivers seat listening to The Clash or The Who and I will definitely be able to hear my brothers drum and bass. I think I need to experience this in action to believe it, but the concept is kinda cool. Citroën say that this car will get a 800km range (497 miles) from the batteries and will do 0-100km/h in 5 seconds. That is fairly rapid but most microwaves are. This definitely has the potential to be a good looking electric coupe? I think it is a coupe I couldn't really tell you and funny enough they haven't said anything about boot space. It has autonomous driving features and some new charging technology that doesn't interest me.
		Overall I would say that this car looks cool, has some funky features and sounds somewhat practical. Certainly it's refreshing not to see an SUV.</p>
