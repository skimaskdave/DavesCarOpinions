		<h1>My Car</h1>
		<p>In this section I talk about my car (or previous cars when I get rid of some).</p>
		<p>You can see what my current car is probably by heading to Instagram. Don't worry, I will link it for you here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/citigodave" target="_blank">@citigodave</a></p>
		<p>This section is sort of a blog of what's happening when.</p>

		<h2>2012 Skoda Citigo S</h2>
		<p>S in this case doesn't stand for sport unfortunately. I don't know what it officially stands for, but it is the base model of the pre-facelift Skoda Citigo. This car is my first car, and I love it. It doesn't come with central locking, electric windows or air conditioning but that doesn't matter, it is brilliant. I have modified it, I put a custom exhuast on it. <a href="https://www.longlife.co.uk/longlife-southampton" target="_blank">Longlife Exhausts</a> in Southampton did that for me. I also bought the Garmin PID device so I have a rev counter and coolant temperature gauage (it has satnav and can show what music is on and also bluetooth calls, but I don't care for any of that, I want to see how fast my engine is spinning and how hot it is). I did what any teenager would do when they like cars, blacked out the badges, put a sunstrip on it and some VRS grille stripes (all of these were eBay specials) but I enjoy modifying my car, and I also enjoyed it stock. It's perfect for going round town, it's tiny so fits through plenty of tight spaces, and into tight spaces when parking. - 23/03/2023

		Update: I have modified it more. I have stuck a VRS badge on the interior (upbadging is cringe) but I bought the badges a year ago so I thought I would at least make the interior a little nicer. I have also added some footwell lights (which I did a few months ago now). I had two sets of alloy wheels (neither of which were on the car), so I have finally sold a set and now can hopefully afford to get the other set on the car. All I need to do is buy some tires. I know, not cheap. In addition to this, I have bought the stuff so I can install a kill switch, however I have not installed said switch yet because to get to the fuel pump relay I have to take the lower part of the dash off, which takes longer than wanted and I really don't want to fanny about with it. - 13/04/2023

		Update: More mods have occured!! We have changed all the wheels of the car. Now with some cheap Facebook Marketplace alloys and a fairly worn Skoda Octavia VRS steering wheel. I could have updated this sooner because the wheels have been on for a decent amount of time now, but they look epic. The wheels have much wider tyres than the standard steelies (195/45/16 instead of the standard 165/70/14). I have a lot more confidence in the tyres now because of the increased amount of rubber. In addition to the new wheels and rubber, I have added a mini spoiler because it's cute and funny. - 25/05/2023</p>
